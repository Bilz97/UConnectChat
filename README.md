### ./src directory

This is the directory where most of our code will be added

The inside of the `src` directory looks similar to the following:

│   ├── forms
│   ├── modals
│   ├── navigation
│   ├── redux
│   ├── screens

```

**components**
This is where our reusable components live which help us build our screens.

**forms**
This is where we'll be storing form components such as sign up, login.

**navigation**
This is where out react navigation structure will be stored

**redux**
There is where our redux store is defined

**screens**
This is where our screen components will live

**services**
Any services that interface with the outside world will live here.

**utils**
This is a great place to put miscellaneous helpers and utilities. Things like date helpers, formatters, etc. can be stored here. However, it should only be used for things that are truly shared across our application.
